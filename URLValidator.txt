Bug report 1:
Name:     
  Valid country domains failing validation.
File:  
  URLValidator.java
Severity:       
  MEDIUM
Priority:
  MEDIUM  
Reported Date:
  25NOV2015
Reason:    
  Countries missing from COUNTRY_CODE_TLD in DomainValidator.java
Status:         
  OPEN
Description:
  All countries after Italy (alphabetically) are omitted from COUNTRY_CODE_TLD array.
Steps to Reproduce: 
  Call isValidAuthority("www.msn.<countryCode>"); where countryCode is
  the top level domain for any country after Italy alphabetically. 
Expected Results:   
  Should return true, but will return false. 
Debugging details:
  Manual testing revealed this bug. One of the partitions obvious to our
  team was the top-level domain since they are many and often are obscure.
  Used the eclipse debugger to localize the fault to isValidCountryCodeTld(), 
  which references the COUNTRY_CODE_TLD array.
